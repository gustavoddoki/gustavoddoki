## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there
I'm Gustavo Daiske Doki, bachelor in Mechanical Engineer and Business Administration. I currently work as Quantitative Risk Analyst at VÃ³rtx.

## ðŸ§ª Experience
I have a lot of experience using Python for many applications. 
In college, for a undergraduate research I developed an algorithm to implement a numerical method to solve an engineering equation, and for my undergraduate thesis I developed a Deep Learning algorithm using Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Deep Operator Networks to solve this same engineering equation with Tensorflow. 
Professionally, I developed process automations with Selenium, web scraping with BeautifulSoup, web applications with Django, natural language processing with Transformers, data manipulation with Pandas, among other applications.
