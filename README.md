## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there
I'm Gustavo Daiske Doki, bachelor in Mechanical Engineer and Business Administration. I currently work as Quantitative Risk Analyst at VÃ³rtx.

## ðŸ§ª Experience
I have a lot of experience using Python for many applications. 

In college, for a undergraduate research I developed an algorithm to implement a numerical method to solve an engineering equation, and for my undergraduate thesis I developed a Deep Learning algorithm using Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Deep Operator Networks to solve this same engineering equation. 

Professionally, I developed process automations, web scraping, web applications, natural language processing, data manipulation, among other applications.
